# Krlio-Mini

Krlio-Mini is a url shortener microservice that powers serving short links when downtime is required for frontend services. This framework will one day power all backend requests to Krl.io and will continue to expand as I learn to write Go more efficently. I hope to make this a more generalized framework others can use.
